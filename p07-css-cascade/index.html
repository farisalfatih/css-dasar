    <h1>CSS Cascade</h1>
    <p>
      In the context of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the term "cascade" refers
      to the process by which styles are applied to HTML elements, taking into
      account various sources and priorities. The cascade is a set of rules that
      determine which styles should be applied when there are conflicting or
      overlapping style declarations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CSS cascade operates based on a hierarchy of sources and specificity
      levels. When you apply styles to HTML elements, the cascade determines
      which styles take precedence in case of conflicts. Here are the key
      factors in the CSS cascade:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Origin of Styles:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User Agent Stylesheet: Default styles provided by the browser for HTML
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          User Stylesheet: Styles specified by the user, often through browser
          extensions or user settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Author Stylesheet: Styles provided by the web page author in the
          linked or embedded CSS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Specificity:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The specificity of a selector determines how specific it is in
          targeting elements. For example, an ID selector (#example) is more
          specific than a class selector (.example).
        </li>
        <li>
          Specificity is crucial in resolving conflicts between different style
          rules.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Order of Appearance:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Styles that appear later in the document or stylesheet can override
          styles declared earlier for the same element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Important Rule:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Styles marked with the !important rule have the highest specificity
          and override other styles. However, it is generally recommended to use
          !important sparingly, as it can make styles harder to manage and
          debug.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
