    <h1>CSS Inheritance</h1>
    <div id="paragraf">
      <p>
        In CSS, inheritance refers to the process by which certain properties of
        a parent element are passed down to its child elements. This allows
        styles to be applied hierarchically in the HTML document, reducing the
        need to explicitly define styles for each individual element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all CSS properties are inherited. Whether a property is inherited or
        not depends on the specific property and its default behavior. For
        example, properties related to font styles, such as font-family,
        font-size, and color, are typically inherited, while properties related
        to layout or positioning, such as width, height, and position, are
        usually not inherited.
      </p>
      <p>Here are a few key points about CSS inheritance:</p>
    </div>

    <main>
      <div id="content">
        <h2>Inherited Properties</h2>
        <p>
          Some commonly inherited properties include font-related properties
          (font-family, font-size, font-weight, etc.), text-related properties
          (color, line-height), and a few others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The default value for inheritance is inherit, but it's often not
          explicitly needed in most cases.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="content">
        <h2>Non-Inherited Properties</h2>
        <p>
          Properties related to layout and positioning (e.g., width, height,
          position) are usually not inherited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The default value for non-inherited properties is often specific to
          the property itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="content">
        <h2>Forcing Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
          You can explicitly force inheritance using the inherit value. For
          example: color: inherit; will explicitly inherit the color property
          from the parent element.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="content">
        <h2>Cascade and Specificity</h2>
        <p>
          The concept of inheritance is closely related to the broader idea of
          the CSS cascade, which determines how styles are applied based on
          source, specificity, and order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Styles closer to the element in the document tree and with higher
          specificity take precedence over inherited styles.
        </p>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
